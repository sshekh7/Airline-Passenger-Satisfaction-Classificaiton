# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Classificaiton
This paper discusses the comparison between binary classifiers run on a dataset of airline passenger satisfaction levels. In particular, the paper compares five different classifiers on the data: K-Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Na¨ıve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, as well as Deep Learning/Neural Network. The results after running each classifier on the dataset indicate that the Random Forest classifier performed best whereas the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier performed the worst. The results of the classifiers and subsequent analysis and retrospective are presented as well.
